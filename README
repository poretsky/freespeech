This is in the process of construction.

The aim is to have a coherent FreeSpeech system.
I have gone over the Donovan diphones and they seem OK.
The other things to check carefully are the carlos,
Rafa and Montse diphones, and the code that uses them.

Did extensive tidying of the lexicon code, making it almost fit for
distribution. I would definitely like to test it well.

realised that what the lexicon code needs is a complete rewrite, for two
reasons. First because the dictionary is excessively large. Secondly,
it would then be suitable for all systems.
