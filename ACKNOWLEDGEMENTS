There are several people to thank for making this program possible.

Paul Taylor and Briony Williams both gave useful advice about
how to build practical high-level components.

Thanks to Alan Black for testing the system, and to Thierry Dutoit
and Vincent Pagel for agitating for an early release of the first version.

Special thanks to Josh Yelon for making a nicer frendlier program.
