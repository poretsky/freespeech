There are actually a couple of possible dictionaries available,subject
to some copyright restrictions. The one that this program was set
up to use is ther CUVOALD dictionary. A description of how to get
hold of it in the file INSTALLATION.

It would be possible, with only a little programming, to use another
British English dictionary instead, such as the BEEP dictionary.
You can find ftp sites for this in the Comp.speech newsgroup FAQ.
