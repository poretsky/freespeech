freespeech (1.0m-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Use Berkeley database instead of gdbm.
  * Get rid of trailing zeros in the database keys.
  * Use regexp support from C library instead of the local
    implementation.
  * Use default database support library version instead of the explicit
    one.
  * Do not claim freephone output file as "probably audio" in it's usage
    info as it is somewhat confusing in fact.
